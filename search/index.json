[{"content":"I got a chance to visit Fville - an FPT Software campus - yesterday. It was an amazing trip, with many exciting experiences and provoking thoughts for me. Before talking about what I think, let\u0026rsquo;s revisit the campus with me, shall we?\nMy experiences The journey began at 12:10 pm. We got picked up by a bus at our school library and head our way straight to Hoa Lac Hi-tech Park, which is about 40km far from my university (you can see the direction below). It took us 50 minutes to get there.\nFor those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know, FPT Software is part of the FPT Corporation - one of the largest groups in Vietnam. This trip was held for students in HUST (like me) to see the chance of internships and working at FPT Software. Fville is one of FPT Software\u0026rsquo;s campuses, a space where its employees work together and enjoy all the facilities that suit their needs.\nOk, back to the story! When we arrived at the Fville, I was stunned by the view of the space. Fville has a modern design and is surrounded by \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; elements - trees, lakes, and grass paths. They even built a dam around the whole site to bring cool air into the buildings.\nThey give names for each floor and part of each floor following the name of streets in Hanoi. If I remember right, the first floor is called \u0026ldquo;Future\u0026rdquo;, with Ba Dinh \u0026amp; Hoan Kiem districts (2 districts of Hanoi), and each room will be named after a street or a lake. They have a map that includes everything about the area, but I forgot to take picture of that (my bad).\nWe went into a big hall, called \u0026ldquo;Chu Sau\u0026rdquo; (Uncle Six?). They welcomed us with a small presentation about FPT, its history, and the corporate culture. After that, we played a small Kahoot about everything we just listened to, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t win it (I hate Kahoot). Next, they split us into groups to play a small game. The game required each team to solve a passcode. Our team solved the passcode shortly, and we found out our objective was to take a picture at the reception desk - which they use to upload on their FB fan page.\nNow that the game is over, we could finally start to visit the building. Our tour guide was an FPT TA (talent acquisition) and an undergraduate student of FPT University. They were both kind, friendly, and energetic (also pretty :\u0026gt;). We got to see the facilities of Fville: gym, billiard, canteen, pool, working space (looks like they come here just to chill \u0026hellip;). They even have a motel that their employee can hire with a maximum of five people/ room for only 100k VND (which means less than a cup of coffee for each?).\nOne thing I like is that they have buses to pick their employees to work and give them catering services, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about how to get there, or buying food on the way home. It\u0026rsquo;s super convenient!\nWe then return to the hall (\u0026ldquo;Chu Sau\u0026rdquo;) to play some team-building games. Our team got 4th out of 6 teams, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, because we had a wonderful time together.\nMy thoughts After spending the afternoon there, having the chance to meet new people and see new things, I think I have learned so many things. Despite being a second-year student, I still struggle to find my path for my career, whether to become a developer to work in software or blockchains, or becoming an IoT engineer, or work at low-code positions like BA, QA, QC, DevOps, or maybe even work in HR, I still don\u0026rsquo;t know. But after the trip, I think I got my answer.\nThe answer is:\n Just do your thing.\n Really, just do your thing. Focus on it and let it guide you. Many of the employees I met yesterday didn\u0026rsquo;t take the job that they learned at the university, but they all seemed happy with their job (at least that\u0026rsquo;s what I thought).\nWhat I mean is, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry that much about what to do in the future. If you have something that you\u0026rsquo;ve already worked on, keep doing it, and be good at it. That thing will lead you to opportunities that you might never think about.\nTrust me, I\u0026rsquo;m speaking from my own experience. Last year I held a TEDx Conference - many ITers considered that a waste of time - but that experience has taught me so many things, and offer me the chance to work and make connections with people, which brought opportunities for me later on. My tour guide at FPT studied at FTU (Foreign Trade University), a university that has nothing to do with technology, but many of her friends are working as Bridge Engineer and DevOps (which required knowledge in IT). And you know what they all have in common?\n They ALL didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do in their junior years, nor intended to do this job.\n Some of them got this position because they joined a club at university and worked on events, and one of them happened to be an event held by FPT. They took their chance to get their internship at FPT through that, and found out their exceptional skills would be suitable to be a DevOps. Do you get what I mean?\nThe right people will come to you at the right time, just when you\u0026rsquo;re doing things you feel right. Don\u0026rsquo;t compare yourself to others, because you\u0026rsquo;ve already known:\nThey\u0026rsquo;re just doing their things.\n","date":"2022-06-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/a-day-at-fville/fpt_hucd6ee4e5b01b39c512e7ae1d6f7ba758_33473_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/a-day-at-fville/","title":"A day at Fville!"},{"content":"A day can be special in many ways. So does the 9th of May.\nIt all started at the beginning of 2018. The year that my life completely changed.\nFour years ago, someone stepped into my life. Someone used to be dreamy and mournful at the same time. Someone added laughter and tears to my daily days, emotions, and things that you could never forget.\nSomeone said yes on this day. Someone received a ring on this day, even though it didn\u0026rsquo;t fit at first. Someone tore me apart on this day, right before many decisive exams - I can still remember I was crying while doing that Toeic test. Someone came back, also on this day, after leaving for half a year, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t stay till the same day four years later.\nWhere did we go wrong?\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s not someone\u0026rsquo;s fault, it\u0026rsquo;s just life separates us into different paths. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t chase after your dream and become a person I\u0026rsquo;ve never known. I achieved more than I can ever think of and become a person I\u0026rsquo;ve never expected. We both have gone so far from our path, increasing the distance between us. Do you think so?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if those years are enough for a lifetime. It\u0026rsquo;s stupid thinking so, but when I try to be in a new relationship or intend to, I just feel like trying to repeat everything in the past. Maybe I let others down, but what can I say?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to be nostalgic or missing someone. In the end, the memories stay, they might haunt you for days and nights, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got over that time. Now I can sit back and be calmful recalling everything, with a smile and pity on my face.\n \u0026ldquo;Hey, what a love story that was!\u0026rdquo;\n If you ever come across this, just know that I cherish all the things we\u0026rsquo;ve been through. All the good and bad memories, all took part in making me who I am today. Maybe one day when everything is long gone, we\u0026rsquo;ll meet again, but as a different, grown person, with all the memories left behind.\nWhatever happened, you and I, we both deserve to be appreciated.\n","date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/reminiscence/img_hu8dad9d72d0d47c396c57f5f0ca02628b_662666_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/reminiscence/","title":"Reminiscence"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s May. Summer is coming, with plenty of work ahead for me.\nFirstly, I have some projects to finish. One is from my club, which is to make some kinda blog website. One is from my class, in which I have to develop software to illustrate some sorting algorithms. Both are pretty challenging and even though I\u0026rsquo;ve been really familiar with such projects, they\u0026rsquo;ll still take me lots of time.\nSecondly, I\u0026rsquo;m competing in the Creative Idea Challenge at my university - a contest for students to present their startup ideas. If I can make it through the final round, I can present my idea in front of many people in English at the B1 lecture hall. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a big day, and I really look forward to that, since that hall is incredibly cool, you can see it below:\nLastly, I\u0026rsquo;m having my mid-term exams at the end of the month, just in time the above contest is over. This semester I\u0026rsquo;m studying 13 subjects, which is an insane number (at least to me). But I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid. I will never give up once I\u0026rsquo;ve set the goals for myself, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how far I can go.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny how terrible and stress I was last week and now I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to get through everything. Today is labour day, and I think I can really sit back, chill out, enjoy the air of my countryside, as I can hardly have the chance to feel it once more the following month. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it peaceful?\nHere.we.go!\n","date":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/dawn-ahead/img_hu821953a3f74399f057fb89f847a78688_419454_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/dawn-ahead/","title":"Dawn Ahead"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s Sunday, the end of the week. Time to go out, refresh, and have yourself some rest after a long, tiring week.\nThe first month of my new semester has passed. I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to study quite hard this semester, and everything seems overwhelming.\nI have two homework this weekend, and both of them are from my coding classes. One is OOP, and the other one is the Programming Technique. Somehow I still haven\u0026rsquo;t finished both. It\u0026rsquo;s frustrating, especially when doubt starts to creep into your mind.\nHow many times have I wondered whether I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen the right major to study or not? I\u0026rsquo;m not a bad student at school, and I can proudly say I belong to the top ones. I know my strength compared to other students and the admiration I get from people. I know all of that.\nBut why do I still feel so empty every Sunday?\nPeople said I should be proud and satisfied with everything I\u0026rsquo;ve got. They think that I\u0026rsquo;m confident, sociable, and extremely good at my major. I even have a better income than most of the students my age.\nOnly if they knew how much I have sacrificed.\nAs I mentioned earlier, my two homework has caused me to doubt myself. It\u0026rsquo;s harmful to your mental health, especially when you\u0026rsquo;ve always tried so hard.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not intelligent. Not at all. Everything I\u0026rsquo;ve got was through trial and error. I hate when people say I\u0026rsquo;m smart, I\u0026rsquo;ll know how to resolve my own problem eventually. Or when they say I\u0026rsquo;m always confident and able to speak freely and get everyone\u0026rsquo;s attention. They don\u0026rsquo;t know my heart always beats like a drum while my body shakes every time.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I always have an unconfident feeling whenever I tackle a difficult problem or situation. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;m reaching my limitations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s even worse when there\u0026rsquo;s no one there for you to share your thoughts. I have friends, and many of them can really lend me an ear, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard for them to understand me thoroughly. They don\u0026rsquo;t know this side of me, partly because I hardly show it, partly because we\u0026rsquo;re basically not in the same league. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying this to dignify myself, but when you\u0026rsquo;re better than people, you\u0026rsquo;ll always feel lonely because they won\u0026rsquo;t ever know how to become someone like you, to feel the way you do.\nAt the end of the day, it will be just me and myself. I wish there could be someone else here, but that\u0026rsquo;s the price I have to pay. Maybe one day I\u0026rsquo;ll be rewarded. One day\u0026hellip;\nUntil then, I still need to be strong. I might have a bad day like today, but I know I\u0026rsquo;ll come back stronger.\nGet yourself up, as a new week is coming.\n","date":"2022-04-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/gloomy-sunday/img_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2287371_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/gloomy-sunday/","title":"Gloomy Sunday"},{"content":"In this tutorial, I want to talk about Use case Diagram, one of the basic knowledge you need to know when studying Object-oriented Programming (OOP). For the illustrations in this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;m using Astah UML, a design tool that supports UML. You can download it here, and learn how to use it with this documentation.\nWhat is a use case diagram? In Object-oriented paradigm, when it comes to designing the system, we often demonstrate that by the Unified Modeling Language (UML). A use case diagram can be used to summarize the details of your system\u0026rsquo;s users and their interaction with the system.\n So what exactly is the user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the system?\n Good question. Supposed that you\u0026rsquo;re building an application, let\u0026rsquo;s say an online Bookstore. In this case, interactions are the things users can do with your application, such as:\n Viewing books Buying books Adding books to cart  You can add as many interactions as you can think of, but you got the point. And we can demonstrate the user\u0026rsquo;s interaction through the Use case Diagram.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s learn how to draw it!\nUse case diagram components There are 5 main components you\u0026rsquo;ll be working with in a use case diagram:\n Actor Use Case Association System Boundary Box Relationships  Actor An actor is a user that interacts with the system. It can be a person, an organization, or even a server/ system.\nIn order to identify the actor, you need to answer this very basic question:\n \u0026ldquo;Who will interact with the application?\u0026rdquo;\n Let\u0026rsquo;s say you need to build an e-commerce website. So who will be the actor here?\n User Admin  Pretty simple, right?\nIn a use case diagram, an actor is normally drawn as a stickman, but it can also be drawn as in the picture below:\nOf course, you can draw the actor at your will, as long as there\u0026rsquo;s a detailed name with it.\nUse case, Association \u0026amp; Boundary These definitions are pretty straightforward, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just give you the concept and their symbols in the use case diagram:\n Use cases: Horizontally shaped ovals that represent the different uses that a user might have. Association: A line between actors and use cases. In complex diagrams, it is important to know which actors are associated with which use cases. System boundary boxes: A box that sets a system scope to use cases. All use cases outside the box would be considered outside the scope of that system. For example: In a bank, a client can only view their transactions, not all the transactions in the system, since that use case is out of their scope.  Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to work with the above components, since they\u0026rsquo;re not hard to understand. The thing that might actually confuse you is Relationships.\nRelationships There are 3 types of relationships:\n Complicated \u0026hellip; Wait, wrong topic  There are 3 types of relationships, again:\n Include Extend Generalization  Include Include is like a must-have relationship between use cases.\nThink about include this way: suppose you\u0026rsquo;re hungry and want to get something to eat. You walk into MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s and say: \u0026ldquo;I want to order food!\u0026rdquo;. But what do you have to do first before that?\nYou have to choose what to eat first!\nAnd you can draw it in your use case diagram like this:\nSo to order food, you need to choose what to buy, pretty reasonable, right? That is the include relationship. Only when you finish choosing can you proceed to the payment. I\u0026rsquo;ve added another include use case to our diagram, \u0026ldquo;Pay the food\u0026rdquo; for later use.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move on to the next one.\nExtend As I said earlier, include is a must-have relationship between use cases. However, extend is optional. That means if a use case is not compulsory, the actor can choose whether to do it, then it\u0026rsquo;s an extend relationship.\nSo if we go back to our previous example, the MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s one. When you pay for your food, it\u0026rsquo;s optional that you tip the waiter. We can demonstrate that in our use case diagram like this:\nAgain, pretty straightforward. When it comes to relationships in the use case diagram, just remember: Include is compulsory, extend is optional.\nGeneralization Generalization is basically to show a parent-child relationship between use cases or even actors. For example:\nSome use cases generalization relationships:\n Login (parent) -\u0026gt; Login with phone/ email (Child) Pay (parent) -\u0026gt; Pay with Paypal/ COD (Child)  Actors generalization relationships:\n Manager -\u0026gt; Staff Wholesalers -\u0026gt; Retailers  I will use our MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s example here again to demonstrate:\nOverall, generalization helps you display your use case diagram more clearer. If you learned Object-oriented programming (OOP), you\u0026rsquo;d realize that generalization is inheritable (Inheritance in OOP), which means the child inherits the parent\u0026rsquo;s properties and relationships of other use cases.\nConclusion Everything I just went through above is just the basics of the use case diagram. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, there\u0026rsquo;s always more to learn, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s enough to draw your OOP assignments at school. Speaking of which, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll end the tutorial by showing you my very first use case diagram (I literally studied how to draw it for 10 mins because I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that assignment\u0026rsquo;s deadline was in 1 hour). See you around!\n(Oh my gosh it\u0026rsquo;s so terrible and faulty..)\n","date":"2022-04-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/uml-use-case-diagram-tutorial/background_hu6f8835bfb4d550680a97dd841449a3e2_1953517_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://hathai25.github.io/p/uml-use-case-diagram-tutorial/","title":"UML: Use Case Diagram Tutorial"},{"content":"You wake up.

Today\u0026rsquo;s the final exam day.\nNah, you didn\u0026rsquo;t forget that. In fact, you knew it was coming, like, a month ago. Yeah, a month ago.\nOne month ago, you got all your exam schedules. You had prepared and listed out everything you need to do to prepare for all those exams, so no big deal! Everything would be fine.\nThree weeks ago, your friend told you about a contest, which you found interesting. Or maybe you didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was that interesting, you just FOMO that you might lose the chance while everyone else didn\u0026rsquo;t. You spent a day just considering that, and in the end, you say no. But you lost a day.\nTwo weeks ago, you were assigned a new task. It\u0026rsquo;s a new and challenging one since you\u0026rsquo;ve never worked on such projects before.

But still, that task was so intriguing, you decided to take that anyway.\nOne week ago, you were still working on that project, at the same time studying for the final subject. You\u0026rsquo;re completely stressed out and exhausted. But more and more works kept on coming, just like Murphy\u0026rsquo;s law:\n \u0026ldquo;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n You started to feel hopeless. Three days to the exam, you had only studied half the subject.\nTwo days to the exam, still no progress. One day to the exam\u0026hellip;\nTiktok, tiktok. Time still ticking.\nOne day to the exam. You felt hopeless. How come everything always has to come at once?\nWell, it\u0026rsquo;s not something new these days. I mean, we all have plenty of work to do. Some we can control. Some we can\u0026rsquo;t.\nBut hey, things still need to be done. It\u0026rsquo;s our responsibility to do that. We can\u0026rsquo;t control what\u0026rsquo;s coming to us, but we can control our emotions and act.

Take a step back, like get some sleep, and return stronger than ever.
